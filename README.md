# PokeFind

Find information on all of your favorite Pokemon.

# API

This uses the pokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

# Deployment

https://pokefind.surge.sh/

This is still a work in progress and more features are being added. To add:

-   More information/detail on the landing page to explain the purpose of the app
-   Register/Login/Back end authentication to allow for the user to save their favorites into their 'Pokedex'
-   Advanced filtering - once I can figure out how to cache the data from the API (it's too large for localStorage).
-   Infinite scroll: for a more performant app, I'd like to load fewer data points in the initial fetch and load more on the click of a button
